# Categorical-Feature-Encoding-Challenge-II

Kaggle project

In this competition, you will be predicting the probability [0, 1] of a binary target column.

The data contains binary features (bin_*), nominal features (nom_*), ordinal features (ord_*) as well as (potentially cyclical) day (of the week) and month features. The string ordinal features ord_{3-5} are lexically ordered according to string.ascii_letters.

Since the purpose of this competition is to explore various encoding strategies. Unlike the first Categorical Feature Encoding Challenge, the data for this challenge has missing values and feature interactions.
